As an Activist, you choose your music carefully. You enjoy a wide range of different artists and genres, but you’re especially particular about what you choose to play. Activists tend to listen to music for the lyrics, more so than listening for the vibe or sound. It’s harder for you to enjoy a song if you can’t resonate with the lyrics. The Activist generally prefers up-tempo music that involves a high degree of energy. Whether it be pump up music during a workout or turning the volume high while driving in the car, the energy you derive from music translates to who you are as a person.
