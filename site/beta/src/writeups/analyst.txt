As an Analyst, you enjoy studying the music beyond the audio file. You may read the lyrics to songs you listen to in order to better understand the artist and the song. You enjoy a wide range of different artists and genres, but you’re especially particular about what you choose to play. Students tend to listen to music for the lyrics, more so than listening for the vibe or sound. It’s harder for you to enjoy a song if you can’t resonate with the lyrics. The Student generally prefers more relaxing music than a sound with more boom. You don’t feel the need to play the loudest music in the room, but whatever you play often requires special attention to detail.
