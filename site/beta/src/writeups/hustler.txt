You enjoy a wide range of different artists and genres, and you’re not too picky when it comes to choosing a particular song. Hustlers tend to gravitate to the general vibe and ambience of a song more than the lyrics. The Hustler ususally prefers up-tempo music that involves a high degree of energy. Whether it be pump up music during a workout or turning the volume high while driving in the car, the energy you derive from music translates to who you are as a person.
