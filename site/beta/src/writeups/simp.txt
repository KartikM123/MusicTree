As a Simp, you love music that emits feeling. You prefer ambient sounds that make you reflect and you have many playlists for many moods. Simps tend to gravitate to the general vibe and ambience of a song more than the lyrics. The Simp generally prefers more relaxing music than a sound with more boom. You don’t feel the need to play the loudest music in the room, but whatever you play often requires special attention to detail.
