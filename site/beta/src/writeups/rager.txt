As a Rager, you love music and the feelings that come from whatever you play. You enjoy a wide range of different artists and genres, but you’re especially particular about what you choose to play. Ragers tend to listen to music for the lyrics, more so than listening for the vibe or sound. It’s harder for you to enjoy a song if you can’t resonate with the lyrics. The Rager generally prefers up-tempo music that involves a high degree of energy. Whether it be pump up music during a workout or turning the volume high while driving in the car, the energy you derive from music translates to who you are as a person.
